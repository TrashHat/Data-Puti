					<p>Our project aims to identify the interconnectedness between series of political unrest from 2016 to present day. Particularly, our project aims to identify patterns between these events and act as a medium for future researchers aiming to understand the political status of the country and formulate means or methods to improve the countryâ€™s current conditions.</p>

						<h3>Background</h3>
						<p>In 2021, Freedom House reported a significantly low scores in political rights and civil liberties for the Philippines. This came after  the Duterte administration failed to secure peace treaties with the CPP-NPA and more, declared them as terrorists. Journalists, activities, and opposing political parties also became main targets of harassment and were labelled as communist sympathizers which resulted in increased risks of physical assault from state forces. Furthermore, the administration forced the closure of Islamic and Indigenous schools and the illegal arrests of their students due to allegations as possible recruitment sites for militants. These are among the previous administration's tactics to subvert insurgency which worsened civil conflicts and allowed them to persist until the current administration.</p>

						<h3>Research Questions</h3>
						<p>1. How interconnected (in terms of geographical and temporal proximity, conflicting sides, cause, etc.) are the conflicts that have occurred since the Duterte administration?</p>
						<p>2. Do conflicts in the Philippines show patterns (e.g. certain times of the year) on when they are more likely to occur?

						<h3>Plan of Action</h3>
						<p>Our approach uses Data Science to analyze and visualize the factors of interconnection (location, date of occurrence, actors, types of event) of the conflicts since the Duterte administration, as well as examine the timestamps and frequency of these incidents to identify the trends in their occurrence. </p>
